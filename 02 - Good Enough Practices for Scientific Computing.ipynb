    "# Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on our sample application in this tutorial, FUNWAVE-TVD, we will introduce some pragmatically-oriented best practices to help us improve our existing software quality and build towards a fully reproducible digital research and developement process. We will draw heavily from community-drivene recommndations published by organizations such as [The Software Carpentry Foundation](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Github](https://github.com), [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov), [RedHat](https://redhat.com), [The Open Science Foundation](http://osf.io), [The Open Container Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org), and the [FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group). In doing so, we build upon community defined specifications and open source technologies readiy available to the open science community, while focusing on how to realize their promise within the context of a tangible use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "In their white paper, \"[Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/),\" the authors succinctly lay out recommenations that beginning researchers can adopt regardless of their current level of computational skill. Throughout this tutorial we will look at a traditional build, test, and run workflow with our FUNWAVE-TVD, then examine what we need to do to improve various aspects of our devleopment cycle, portability, reproducibility, automation, collaboration, and publication using the Good Enough recommendations. We will adjust our example app as we go to address the Good Enough recommendations using real-world solutions with open source technologies that adhere as closely as possible to any standards available today.\n",
    "\n",
    "We briefly lay out the Good Enough recommendations that we will touch in the remainder off this notebook for reference. "
