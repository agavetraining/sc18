    "* **Source Repository:** The VCS system or repository that contains the content you wish to automate. In our case, it is the Funwave TVD repository containing the application code, build app, and Dockerfile.\n",
    "* **Triggers:** These are events, often time-based events or git lifecycle events, that Jenkins will watch for. When a trigger event occurs, Jenkins will start the associated pipeline.\n",
    "* **Build environment:** The environment that your build process will be executed in. In our case, it is the Agave build app.\n",

There are a variety of strategies for managing these, some of which are discussed in the _Recommended Reading_ for this section.
