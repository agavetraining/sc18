There are two primary types of jobs supported by Jenkins: the freestyle job, and the pipeline job. Freestyle jobs are the easiest to set up initially, but they are difficult to manage over time and they necessarily separate build and deployment code from application code, giving you a split perspective on your project.\n",

    "* **Source Repository:** The VCS system or repository that contains the content you wish to automate. In our case, it is the Funwave TVD repository containing the application code, build app, and Dockerfile.\n",
    "* **Triggers:** These are events, often time-based events or git lifecycle events, that Jenkins will watch for. When a trigger event occurs, Jenkins will start the associated pipeline.\n",
    "* **Build environment:** The environment that your build process will be executed in. In our case, it is the Agave build app.\n",
    "* **Parameters:** Arguments supplied to the job at runtime that exposed to the pipeline script as environment variables.\n",
    "* **Secrets and Config:** Credentials and site-specific configuration necessary for your build pipeline. There are a variety of strategies for managing these, some of which are discussed in the _Recommended Reading_ for this section. For simplicity, we will simply include config and secrets in the pipeline in the tutorial pipeline.\n",
