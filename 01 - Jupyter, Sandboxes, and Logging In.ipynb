    "# Jupyter environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Website](http://jupyter.org/) [Project repository](https://github.com/jupyter)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a Jupyter server as the primary web interface for this workshop. Several notebooks have been provided to you, in advance, to guide you through the workshop. After the workshop, you may use the [Agave Jupyter image](https://hub.docker.com/r/agaveplatform/jupyter-notebook/) to recreate the notebook server and repeat the workshop, or continue on with your own work at your leisure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Agave image has several customizations to facilitate use of the platform and ease much of the heavy lifting done behind the scenes in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Jupyter server is an extension of the Jupyter project's official datascience notebook server. It has multiple kernels available for use right away. We have preconfigured them with several useful libraries and tools to help you get up and running with common tasks easier. Additionally, we have bundled in Agave CLI and Python & R SDK into the Bash, Python 2, Python 3, and R kernels respectively. A brief rundown of each kernel environment is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 2**\n",
    "* Standard CPython 2.7 environment\n",
    "* Agave Python SDK \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 3**  \n",
    "* Conda Python 3.6 environment\n",
    "* pandas, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scikit-image, sympy, cython, patsy, statsmodel, cloudpickle, dill, numba, bokeh pre-installed\n",
    "* Agave Python SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "**R Kernel**  \n",
    "* Conda R v3.3.x and channel\n",
    "* Cran and Microsoft application networks preconfigured.\n",
    "* plyr, devtools, shiny, rmarkdown, forecast, rsqlite, reshape2, nycflights13, caret, rcurl, and randomforest pre-installed\n",
    "* The [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) R packages are also installed, including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, lubridate, and broom\n",
    "* Agave R SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "**Julia Kernel**  \n",
    "* Julia v0.6.x\n",
    "* Gadfly, RDatasets, and HDF5 pre-installed\n",

    "### Notebook plugins  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the custom kernels, the Jupyter Widget plugin is also installed to enable the creation of graphical user interface elements within your notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shared file system\n",
    "\n",
    "The $HOME/work directory is a share file system between the Jupyter server and your sandbox, so you can copy data between the two environments quickly and easily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Web console\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter contains a web terminal that can be used to access your sandbox environment or interact with the Jupyter container itself. To login to your sandbox from the Jupyter web terminal, simply run the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh -p 10022 $VM_IPADDRESS  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial notebooks  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is presented as a series of Jupyter notebooks. Whether you are attending this tutorial in person, or following along after the fact, your first step should be to open the `INSTALL.ipynb` file in the home directory of your notebook server and through every cell. This will download the [latest version of the training notebooks](https://github.com/agavetraining/sc18) from Github and install them on your notebook server. \n",
    "\n",
    "If for whatever reason you need to restore the notebooks, you can simply rerun the `INSTALL.ipynb` notebook in its entirety and it will back up your current workspace and reinstall fresh copies of the training notebooks from Github. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### API access  \n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial walks you through the process of obtaining a set of API keys and authenticating to the Agave Platform. Once this is done, you no longer need to authenticate to follow the tutorial. Both the Agave CLI and SDKs will pick up your authorization cache and automatically refresh it as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extras\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of the `examples` directory, you will find several notebooks to help you learn more about the Agave platform, containers, and SciOps. We leave these for you to follow after the tutorial.\n"

    "To login to the sandbox from outside the Jupyter server, use the host IP address. You will find the public IP address of your sandbox in the `$VM_IPADDRESS` environment variable. Valid ssh keys are available in the `~/.ssh` director of your Jupyter server. Alternatively, you can append your own public key to the `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.  \n",

If you need to persist your data, it is recommended that you move it to another host, or [create your own account](https://public.agaveapi.co/create_account) in the Agave public tenant and save your data in the free cloud storage available there by default.\n"
